# Introduction
One of the things that I wish I had living my day to day life was having a place to write down notes and look at them from anywhere, either through my phone, laptop or computer. Notes4U is an application I made using React and Firebase that allows us to do exactly that. The application is accessed through passwordless email verification making it quick and easy to write your notes.

# Technology
Creating this website I was able to familiarize myself with:
* React.js Components
* React.js Hooks (State/Effect/Context)
* Asynchronous API (async/await)
* UI Framework (MaterialUI)
* JSX, CSS(TailWind)
* Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)

Other libraries used:
* React Router
* React Icons
* React Loading Spin
